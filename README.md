### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
In this project, I will make use of **Python** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington). I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Libraries used
1. time: to measure time the script took to execute.
2. pandas: to perform analysis on the city data via the use of data-frames.
